# Readme

This repository contains Python codes and scripts that I use regularly
for merging several PDFs together (`merger.py`) and splitting them
into $N$ number of PDF files (`splitter.py`), one for each of its pages.

These codes need `PyPDF2` to run. For more information 
on this module and how to install them, please see 
[its official PyPi page](https://pypi.org/project/PyPDF2/).
